Oh, this is all so exciting—such a rich lineup! Each of those books has some *gorgeous* quote potential for watercolor cards. Here are a few ideas that feel especially “card-worthy” (whether for beauty, humor, or wisdom):

**Moby-Dick (Herman Melville):**

\

Melville is so lyrical and vast—it’s all sea, soul, and human struggle. Some shorter, art-friendly lines:

• **“I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing.”**

*(Resilience, adventure, perfect for an encouragement card.)*

• **“A smile is the chosen vehicle for all ambiguities.”**

*(Playful, mysterious—great for a quirky, artsy vibe.)*

• **“Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded forever.”**

*(This would pair so well with a soft, watery blue-green painting.)*

• **“There is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.”**

*(For a more wry, knowing kind of card—ideal for literary friends.)*

• **“Ignorance is the parent of fear.”**

*(A little more serious, but feels timeless—like a card for someone facing something new.)*

**Cranford (Elizabeth Gaskell):**

\

Gaskell’s voice is so warm, gentle, and quietly humorous. These would fit that lovely, cozy watercolor aesthetic:

• **“There is always a pleasure in unraveling a mystery, in catching at the gossamer clue which will guide to certainty.”**

*(Perfect with soft, delicate lines—like thread, lace, or gentle florals.)*

• **“A man is so in the way in the house!”**

*(Hilarious and so Cranford—imagine this with a little teapot or floral pattern.)*

• **“I’d rather be jolly.”**

*(Simple, delightful—great for a bright, cheerful card.)*

• **“I am not ashamed to own that I love the old-fashioned things.”**

*(Vintage vibes! Perfect alongside your watercolor florals, teacups, or an old key.)*

• **“Kindness is the oil that takes the friction out of life.”**

*(Gentle wisdom—would work beautifully with warm, soft colors.)*

**Pride and Prejudice (Jane Austen):**

\

So much gold here—it’s Austen!

• **“I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.”**

*(Sharp, funny—perfect with something a little sassy.)*

• **“You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.”**

*(Classic. Romantic. Perfection with soft blush tones or delicate roses.)*

• **“I am half agony, half hope.”**

*(Technically Persuasion, but still Austen, and it’s iconic. Would be stunning with stormy watercolor shades.)*

• **“What are men to rocks and mountains?”**

*(A favorite! Nature-inspired—cool tones, mountain washes.)*

• **“I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!”**

*(Ultimate bookish card. Stack of books + cozy colors? Yes, please.)*

How do these feel? Any stand out, or spark other ideas? I can dig deeper into any one of the books if you want more gems!

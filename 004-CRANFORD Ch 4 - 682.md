## Pre-hash Notes
Chapter 4: A Visit to an Old Bachelor
- Miss Matty and friends visit Mr. Holbrook’s farm, rekindling old feelings. Shortly after, Mr. Holbrook falls ill and dies.
- Miss Matilda SATE bolt upright (not a typo)
- Pinks and ***gilly***-flowers
- Poet George Herbert—EUAN TO RECORD
- Turkey carpet - Turkish carpet
- Flag floor - flagstone floor
- Pudding before meat and “no broth no ball; no ball, no beef” - eat something to take the edge off before you get to the most expensive part of the meal—the meat, a “ball” would have been a suet dumpling which was, apparently, a Yorkshire-area “old way” but I’m going to defer to listeners who know better.
- Old fashioned forks - like 16th Century/1500s - were two-tine forks. Think hand-sized, long prongs like a small meat stabbity thing. By 1800 most of these had been replaced by four-prong forks.
- “Aminé at her grains of rice after her previous feast with the Ghoul” - Arabian Nights (1765-8) Aminé is wife of Sidi Norman who notices she only eats rice with a bodkin. He figures out she’s a Ghoul who goes to cemeteries at night to feast on the newly-buried dead so rice was pretty ‘meh’ for her. **CHECK ON THIS**
- “Unbecoming [***calashes***](https://collections.mfa.org/objects/116425) to put on over their caps” - threw me b/c of the Caleche’s in Dracula - turns out they’re related! Retractable hood to put over a cap! PICTURE TO SHARE
- Some Tennyson will pop up - a line about cedars from 1842’s “The Gardiner’s Daughter” and in the original text the line before the one about the cedars appeared talking about the color of ASHBUDS ”black as ashbuds”- It’s missing from the published version so a conversation turn would have been less of an utter non-sequiter in the OG version.
- There will be a marvelous joke line for the crocheters in our midst. These are the reasons I love EG so much
- “Locksley Hall” by Tennyson - a lover revisits the place where he fell in love with a woman who was forced to marry someone else. So - not included accidentally.
- Visiting rules - it would be Making A Statement for a gentleman to call on a lady directly…or at least it would when the lady were younger. This is part of why Capt Brown’s visits flustered Miss Jenkyns

## Post-chapter Notes
- “My cousin might make a drive, I think,” said Miss Pole, who was afraid of ear-ache, and had only her cap on— spectacular set of non-sequiters (p41)
- 26 cows named after letters of the alphabet. Gaskell has a thing for quirky cows? <3 
- LOVE Mary Smith’s description of Mr Holbrook in the garden Bierrrron and Go-ëthee pronunciations and his joyful connection of garden and poetry - but the best is his sitting room strewn with books chosen for his pleasure not for the classical or established reputations. <3
- I saw, I imitated, I survived - Mary Smith as Cæsar - using rounded knife tip as a spoon-ish food delivery device
- I had NO IDEA it would have been an honor to fill a man’s pipe!!!!?!
- “I only hope it is not improper; so many pleasant things are” and “Uncouth is too hard a word. I should call him eccentric; very clever people always are!” - GOD I love Miss Marty.
- LOVE Mr Hollbrook’s Black as ashbuds thing - and how he never knew and is proud of never knowing/learning from a poet.
- Miss pole encouraged poetry reading so she could count her stitches :D 
- I love the Hollbrook’s actions “flutter” Miss Matty - not FLUSTER. <3 
- “I don’t believe frogs will agree with him” HA!!!! And “he used to have to be careful about what he ate” shows more knowledge of each other than she’d betrayed before.
- We learn that Martha may not have known how to serve at table, but she DOES know how to read and write - she writes a few lines to Mary Smith to keep her up to date on Miss Matty.
- “Wicked Paris where they are always having revolutions” HA!
- TWO chapters where love conquers - Miss Jenkyns “the most proper place for his arm to be!” With Miss Jessie— and here, Miss Matty and Martha “God forbid that I should grieve any young hearts.”
